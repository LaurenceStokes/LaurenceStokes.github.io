Hi, I'm Laurence Stokes and I'm a Fullstack Software Developer. I've made this blog/site/ to document my adventures in the realm of software development, computer security, and any other computer science related topics that may pique my interest in the future. I may also post other stuff on here too; I'm currently undecided of the direction I want to take with it.

Before becoming a "professional" Software Developer I studied Computer Science at the [University of Birmingham, UK](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. 

Of course, it should go without staying, but all of the opinions and suchlike expressed herein are my own and not that of my employer/past employers/past employer's cat.
